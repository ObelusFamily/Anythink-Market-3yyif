## First setup

**[TODO 05/01/2018 @vanessa-cooper]:** _It's been a while since anyone ran a fresh copy of this repo. I think it's worth documenting the steps needed to install and run the repo on a new machine?_
Step 1 : Install the Docker application. After installing check in command prompt with command("docker -v" and "docker-compose -v")
Step 2 : Open the link pop up after running Docker application and follow the steps mention in command prompt.
Step 3 : Now install any Linux Distribution application from the Microsoft playstore(if Windows)
Step 4 : After all this process sign in the Docker app and the Docker will start running.
Step 5 : Go to the file directory where the clone file is located and run command in cmd "docker-compose up", it will take some time.
Step 6 : Click the localhost link provided to check whether the docker is running properly or not and same for the front end.
